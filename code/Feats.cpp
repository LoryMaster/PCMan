A cohort is generally an NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs. See Table 5â€“2 for what level of cohort and how many followers you can recruit.\r\n\r\nLeadership  Modifiers:  Several  factors  can  affect  your Leadership  score,  causing  it  to  vary  from  the  base  score (character level + Cha modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score: (TODO: Leader Reputation Table).Other  modifiers  may  apply  when  you  try  to  attract  a cohort, as listed below. (TODO: Leader Modifier Table). Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.  (TODO: Follower Modifier Table).\r\n\r\nLeadership Score: Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or  higher  in  order  to  gain  the  Leadership  feat.  Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above.\r\n\r\nCohort Level: You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a  cohort  who  is  two  or  more  levels  lower  than  yourself. The  cohort  should  be  equipped  with  gear  appropriate for its level (see Chapter 14). A cohort can be of any race or  class.  The  cohortâ€™s  alignment  may  not  be  opposed  to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a â€“1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.A  cohort  does  not  count  as  a  party  member  when determining  the  partyâ€™s  XP.  Instead,  divide  the  cohortâ€™s level  by  your  level.  Multiply  this  result  by  the  total  XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohortâ€™s total. If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower  than  your  level,  the  cohort  does  not  gain  the  new levelâ€”its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.\r\n\r\nNumber of  Followers  by  Level:  You  can  lead  up  to  the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except theyâ€™re generally low-level NPCs. Because theyâ€™re usually 5 or more levels behind you, theyâ€™re rarely effective in combat. Followers  donâ€™t  earn experience  and  thus  donâ€™t  gain levels.  When  you  gain  a  new  level,  consult  Table  5â€“2  to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may  be  higher  level  than  the  existing  followers. Donâ€™t consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.",
