If you do not choose to act as if you were disabled, you immediately fall unconscious.When using this feat, you are staggered. You can take a  move  action  without  further  injuring  yourself,  but  if you  perform  any  standard  action  (or  any  other  action deemed as strenuous, including some swift actions, such as casting a quickened spell) you take 1 point of damage after completing the act. If your negative hit points are equal  to  or  greater  than  your  Constitution  score,  you immediately die.\r\n\r\nNormal: A character without this feat who is reduced to negative hit points is unconscious and dying.",
